pod2pdf for Debian
==================

The README file mentions Paper::Specs which is not yet available for
Debian. It would be lovely if someone could address the respective
packaging work.

dh-make-perl suggests the package to be named libpod2pdf-perl, but
since the package will mostly be used as a binary, I have decided
against that convention.
